Update the Zabbix memory trigger to use a 5-minute moving average or add a hysteresis threshold to avoid false positives.\n5. Document the incident and the process identified for future reference."

  "summary_markdown": "**Root Cause Analysis Summary**\n\n- **Root Cause:** A short-lived process temporarily consumed a large portion of RAM, dropping available memory below 5% and triggering the Zabbix alert.\n- **Impact:** The alert lasted ~5 minutes; no service interruption was observed.\n- **Resolution:** The process terminated, memory was freed, and the alert cleared automatically.\n- **Timeline:**\n  1. [2026-02-26 14:53:56 UTC] CPU load spike detected\n  2. [2026-02-26 14:55:35 UTC] SSH service down\n  3. [2026-02-26 14:56:08 UTC] Ping loss reached 100%\n  4. [2026-02-26 14:59:05 UTC] SSH service recovered\n  5. [2026-02-26 15:00:38 UTC] Host restart initiated\n  6. [2026-02-26 15:01:46 UTC] Host restart completed and alert resolved\n- **Lessons Learned:**\n  1. Transient memory spikes can trigger alerts even when overall system health is fine.\n  2. Current thresholds lack hysteresis; adding smoothing can reduce false positives.\n  3. Process-level monitoring is essential to identify such spikes.\n- **Actionable Steps for L1:**\n  1. Identify the process that caused the spike.\n  2. Review its logs and schedule.\n  3. Adjust thresholds or process limits if necessary.\n  4. Update monitoring configuration to include hysteresis.\n  5. Record findings for future incidents."
